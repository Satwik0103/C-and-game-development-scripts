//Explanation of code-
1) A Timer Class is created
2) 4 variables total sec=0,elapsed sec=0,bool running=false and bool started =false is set up
3) Duration method sets or assign the value in total seconds if not running
4) A function void run is made which tells if func is runing then set running=true and started=true
5) Running function returns bool value of running
6) Update func is used to update time and check for finished
7) Increment elapsed time by elapsed time=elapsed time + Time.deltatime(pre defined func) until elapsedtime > totaltime 
8) If elapsedtime >totaltime running=false
9) Finished func returns bool value of started and not running
